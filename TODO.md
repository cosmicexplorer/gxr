TODO
====

(in topological order)

1. do types and variables in c with multiple files (don't forget about static!)
2. make preprocessor macros work (be able to read their expansion as well)
3. add struct/class member decls/refs
4. add aliases (typedefs and pointer/reference)
5. extend to c++ (templates, namespaces, virtual functions!)
6. remove requirement to include clang headers, or at least automate it
7. integrate with doxygen comments
8. produce groff or something that emacs can browse super easy (and give it links to the source so it can be used like gtags)
