TODO
====

(in topological order)

1. do types and variables in c with multiple files
2. add static variables
3. make preprocessor macros work (be able to read their expansion as well)
4. add struct/class member decls/refs
5. add conditional compilation support
6. add aliases (typedefs and pointer/reference (the pointer/reference thing could be super cool!!!!!))
7. add labelstmt and labelref to decls/refs
  - don't think there's an alias analogy; unless multiple labels go to the same place (lol)
8. extend to c++ (templates, namespaces, virtual functions!)
9. add client/server architecture (or something similarly easy to integrate with makefiles)
  - remove requirement to include clang headers, or at least automate it
10. integrate with doxygen comments
11. produce groff or something that emacs can browse super easy (and give it links to the source so it can be used like gtags)
